### Improvements
 
 * Add weight values to dictionaries
     - I think it is nice to keep the words sorted in alphabetical order, but add a value to query them first, or add keywords, so you can add hints and those words will be tested first.
 * Fix spanish characters encoding: such as 'ñ'... and maybe 'ü', 'á', check if the answers work without special characters
