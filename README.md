TO-DO

### Dictionaries

 * Common nouns
 * Common verbs (infinitive)
 * Famous people
 * Animals
 * Places
 * Spanish alphabet with letter numbers
 
### Images
 
 * Braille alphabet
 * Morse code

### Improvements
 
 * Add weight values to dictionaries
     - I think it is nice to keep the words sorted in alphabetical order, but add a value to query them first, or add keywords, so you can add hints and those words will be tested first.
 * Fix spanish characters encoding: such as 'ñ'... and maybe 'ü', 'á', check if the answers work without special characters
 * Add a fuzzy search over all dictionaries (js+html interface)
 * Add a regexp search over all dictionaries (js+html interface)
